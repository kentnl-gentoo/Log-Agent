. Description:	0.3.7

        Replaced a non-localized modification $^W with "no warnings" so
        warnings are no disabled globally.  Thanks to Andreas Vierengel for
        pointing this out.

        Fixed formatting behavior for strings that contain "%%" without any
        other formating characters.  Thanks to David Coppit for this one.

        Fixed a minor undef warning in a major kludge in the Agent::Driver
        code.

. Description:  0.3.6

        Stripped line endings in common tests to allow tests to succeed
        under non-UN*X environments.  Also replaced an unnecessary handle
        alias with the actual file name in t/file.t.  Thanks to Jay Lawrence 
        and Terrence Brannon for pointing out the test problems.

Sat Sep 27 13:56:58 EDT 2003   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.5

        Added a wrapper for &AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD to save the value
        of $!, which is often clobbered before the substitution of
        "%m" by logxxx().

        Added a META.yml file and disabled autogeneration in Makefile.PL.

Sat Mar  8 11:43:41 EST 2003   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.4

        Made the logxxx() calls transparent to all (current)
        sprintf() formatting patterns.  Not all formatting
        errors will be caught before passed to sprintf(), but 
        the obviously malformed ones will be detected.

        Added support for embedded newlines in messages passed to
        logcarp() and logxcarp().

Mon Sep 30 23:48:20 EDT 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.3

        Removed the problematic t/mail.t test.  The test fails due
        to problems with redirecting the output of Mail::Mailer in
        test mode.

Thu Aug  1 23:44:06 EDT 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.2

        Expanded &Carp::shortmess workaround in Log::Agent::Driver to
        handle behavior under Perl 5.8.0.

Sun May 12 05:05:46 EDT 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.1p2

        Added prechecks for sprintf() arguments in Log::Agent::Formatting.

        Added argument for Mail::Mailer options in
        Log::Agent::Driver::Mail->make().

Thu Apr 25 22:51:11 EDT 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.1p1

        Added trial Log::Agent::Driver::Mail for sending log messages
        via email.

        Minor changes to version control.

Mon Mar 18 13:15:38 EST 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.1

        Removed paranoid argument test from Log::Agent::Driver::Fork::make(),
        now relying on later failure for invalid argument.  Only testing
        with ref() now.

Sat Feb 23 03:14:37 EST 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.0

        Added Log::Agent::Driver::Fork to allow logconfig() to accept
        multiple drivers at once.

        Added file permission arguments to Log::Agent::Driver::File and
        Log::Agent::Channel::File.

        Corrected "uninitialized value" in Log::Agent::Tag::Caller caused
        by undefined $subroutine.

Wed Apr 11 17:54:44 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Added hyperlinks within POD to ease web browsing of manpage.

        Routines from Log::Agent::Priorities are now auto-loaded.

        Normalize priority string ("err" -> "error") when logging it,
        Indeed, Log::Agent::Logger uses those routines but makes
        strict use of syslog priority names.

Sat Mar 31 12:03:15 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Massive renaming Devel::Datum -> Carp::Datum.

        Fixed =over to add explicit indent level, for POD checkers.

        Fixed off-by-one error in prio_from_level(), which caused
        improper conversion for level 10.

Thu Mar 15 00:42:22 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Updated version number.

Thu Mar 15 00:41:24 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Forgot to handle -prefix in Log::Agent::Channel::Syslog.

        Was wrongly issuing test headers twice when skipping
        the t/tag_callback.t tests.

Tue Mar 13 20:15:37 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Fixed typo in -priority documentation.

        Manual page for Log::Agent::Tag::Priority was irrelevant.

Tue Mar 13 19:52:02 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Added the -priority and -tags options to logconfig() for
        including priority string in messages, as well as user-defined
        tag strings.

        Test the ${line} variable substitution in caller formatting.

        Fixed bug for *BSD systems, which caused the test suite to fail.

        Class Log::Agent::Caller disappered, and is now replaced by
        Log::Agent::Tag::Caller.

        9 new files, 1 file suppressed.

Sun Nov 12 15:48:21 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Version 0.2.1.

        Minor typo fixes.

Mon Nov  6 20:12:06 MET 2000    Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

        Version 0.2.0

        Modularized the logging channels.  They have now their own hierarchy
        under Log::Agent::Channel.

        Modularized priority, prefixing and timestamping routines, so that
        they can be re-used by satellite Log::Agent modules.

        Logging from Log::Agent is now subject to pruning depending on the
        logging level set.  By default, it is "notice", so that even logsay()
        is visible.

Sun Oct  1 22:05:51 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Version 0.1.8

        Added support for Devel::Datum.  This module is still under
        development, but is already used in production system.

        New logcarp, logxcarp and logxcroak interface.

        Fixed carpmess to work around Carp's incorrect offseting and
        added a test suite for logcarp and logxcarp.

        5 new files.

Tue Jul  4 22:03:04 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Forgot to increase version number at last patch.

Tue Jul  4 22:01:55 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Was missing default init check before calling logwrite(),
        resulting in a call on an undefined referenced in logtrc()
        and logdbg() when no explicit configuration was otherwise made.
Tue Jun 20 23:27:14 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Added logcroak(), to die from the perspective of the caller.

        New logwrite() routine for upper-level apps, which unconditionally
        logs messages to a specified channel.

        Fixed arg processing to avoid dying on 2nd calls to logconfig().

        Fixed typos in debug init and man page.

        Removed logtrc() and logdbg() from the driver interface: they are
        now frozen in Log::Agent, and implemented in terms of logwrite(),
        which may be redefined as suited.

Thu Mar 30 21:25:23 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent/Caller.pm.

Sun Mar  5 23:30:16 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Added missing 1 for require and fixed typo in pod for
        Log::Agent::Caller as was reported by many people.

        All .pm files now have an __END__ marker before the pod
        section anyway, so that the Perl parser stops.

        Added support for logfile rotation via Log::Agent::Rotate.

        No longer uses IO::Handle but relies on the new
        Log::Agent::File hierarch, to support logfile rotation.
        Native Perl files are now handled via Log::Agent::File::Native.

        Suppressed blurb about the Linux bug since we workaround it by
        creating a new separate default_exp.t test.

        Three new files.

Thu Dec  9 18:31:30 MET 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Wrote two versions of format_args and eval proper one.
        Indeed, perl-5.005 versions do not support /(?<!)/ and
        this is parsed at compile time, hence we need to protect
        the expression within an eval.

Wed Dec  8 22:53:27 MET 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

        Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent.pm.

        Mentions that perl 5.005 fails tests on Linux due to a perl or
        glibc bug. It's only the test code that fails though.

Tue Dec  7 22:01:49 MET 1999  Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>
. Description

        Initial revision 0.1.
