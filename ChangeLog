. Description:

	Wrote two versions of format_args and eval proper one.
	Indeed, perl-5.005 versions do not support /(?<!)/ and
	this is parsed at compile time, hence we need to protect
	the expression within an eval.

. Description:

	Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent.pm.

	Mentions that perl 5.005 fails tests on Linux due to a perl or
	glibc bug. It's only the test code that fails though.
