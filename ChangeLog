. Description:

	Added missing 1 for require and fixed typo in pod for
	Log::Agent::Caller as was reported by many people.

	All .pm files now have an __END__ marker before the pod
	section anyway, so that the Perl parser stops.

	Added support for logfile rotation via Log::Agent::Rotate.

	No longer uses IO::Handle but relies on the new
	Log::Agent::File hierarch, to support logfile rotation.
	Native Perl files are now handled via Log::Agent::File::Native.

	Suppressed blurb about the Linux bug since we workaround it by
	creating a new separate default_exp.t test.

	Three new files.

. Description:

	Wrote two versions of format_args and eval proper one.
	Indeed, perl-5.005 versions do not support /(?<!)/ and
	this is parsed at compile time, hence we need to protect
	the expression within an eval.

. Description:

	Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent.pm.

	Mentions that perl 5.005 fails tests on Linux due to a perl or
	glibc bug. It's only the test code that fails though.
