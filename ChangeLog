. Description:  0.3.1

        Removed paranoid argument test from Log::Agent::Driver::Fork::make(),
        now relying on later failure for invalid argument.  Only testing
        with ref() now.

Sat Feb 23 03:14:37 EST 2002   Mark Rogaski <mrogaski@cpan.org>

. Description:  0.3.0

        Added Log::Agent::Driver::Fork to allow logconfig() to accept
        multiple drivers at once.

        Added file permission arguments to Log::Agent::Driver::File and
        Log::Agent::Channel::File.

        Corrected "uninitialized value" in Log::Agent::Tag::Caller caused
        by undefined $subroutine.

. Description:

	Added hyperlinks within POD to ease web browsing of manpage.

	Routines from Log::Agent::Priorities are now auto-loaded.

	Normalize priority string ("err" -> "error") when logging it,
	Indeed, Log::Agent::Logger uses those routines but makes
	strict use of syslog priority names.

Sat Mar 31 12:03:15 MEST 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Massive renaming Devel::Datum -> Carp::Datum.

	Fixed =over to add explicit indent level, for POD checkers.

	Fixed off-by-one error in prio_from_level(), which caused
	improper conversion for level 10.

Thu Mar 15 00:42:22 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Updated version number.

Thu Mar 15 00:41:24 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Forgot to handle -prefix in Log::Agent::Channel::Syslog.

	Was wrongly issuing test headers twice when skipping
	the t/tag_callback.t tests.

Tue Mar 13 20:15:37 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Fixed typo in -priority documentation.

	Manual page for Log::Agent::Tag::Priority was irrelevant.

Tue Mar 13 19:52:02 MET 2001   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added the -priority and -tags options to logconfig() for
	including priority string in messages, as well as user-defined
	tag strings.

	Test the ${line} variable substitution in caller formatting.

	Fixed bug for *BSD systems, which caused the test suite to fail.

	Class Log::Agent::Caller disappered, and is now replaced by
	Log::Agent::Tag::Caller.

	9 new files, 1 file suppressed.

Sun Nov 12 15:48:21 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 0.2.1.

	Minor typo fixes.

Mon Nov  6 20:12:06 MET 2000    Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

	Version 0.2.0

	Modularized the logging channels.  They have now their own hierarchy
	under Log::Agent::Channel.

	Modularized priority, prefixing and timestamping routines, so that
	they can be re-used by satellite Log::Agent modules.

	Logging from Log::Agent is now subject to pruning depending on the
	logging level set.  By default, it is "notice", so that even logsay()
	is visible.

Sun Oct  1 22:05:51 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Version 0.1.8

	Added support for Devel::Datum.  This module is still under
	development, but is already used in production system.

	New logcarp, logxcarp and logxcroak interface.

	Fixed carpmess to work around Carp's incorrect offseting and
	added a test suite for logcarp and logxcarp.

	5 new files.

. Description:

	Forgot to increase version number at last patch.

Tue Jul  4 22:01:55 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Was missing default init check before calling logwrite(),
	resulting in a call on an undefined referenced in logtrc()
	and logdbg() when no explicit configuration was otherwise made.
Tue Jun 20 23:27:14 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added logcroak(), to die from the perspective of the caller.

	New logwrite() routine for upper-level apps, which unconditionally
	logs messages to a specified channel.

	Fixed arg processing to avoid dying on 2nd calls to logconfig().

	Fixed typos in debug init and man page.

	Removed logtrc() and logdbg() from the driver interface: they are
	now frozen in Log::Agent, and implemented in terms of logwrite(),
	which may be redefined as suited.

Thu Mar 30 21:25:23 MEST 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent/Caller.pm.

Sun Mar  5 23:30:16 MET 2000   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Added missing 1 for require and fixed typo in pod for
	Log::Agent::Caller as was reported by many people.

	All .pm files now have an __END__ marker before the pod
	section anyway, so that the Perl parser stops.

	Added support for logfile rotation via Log::Agent::Rotate.

	No longer uses IO::Handle but relies on the new
	Log::Agent::File hierarch, to support logfile rotation.
	Native Perl files are now handled via Log::Agent::File::Native.

	Suppressed blurb about the Linux bug since we workaround it by
	creating a new separate default_exp.t test.

	Three new files.

Thu Dec  9 18:31:30 MET 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Wrote two versions of format_args and eval proper one.
	Indeed, perl-5.005 versions do not support /(?<!)/ and
	this is parsed at compile time, hence we need to protect
	the expression within an eval.

Wed Dec  8 22:53:27 MET 1999   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>

. Description:

	Forgot that /(?<!)/ is a 5.005 feature, fixed Agent.pm.

	Mentions that perl 5.005 fails tests on Linux due to a perl or
	glibc bug. It's only the test code that fails though.

Tue Dec  7 22:01:49 MET 1999  Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>
. Description

	Initial revision 0.1.
